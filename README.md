# [Personal Website](https://edmunddong.github.io)

Created to replace my [old site](https://sites.google.com/view/eedong/) since it needed some work.

## New things I learned how to do:

- Making my first personal site from scratch
- How to work push github pages through domain registrar and external dns provider

## Todo:

- [ ] Move footer back to footer on mobile
- [ ] Research font weights, accessibility, common practice. I like light fonts, but that might not mean the world does
- [ ] Fix profile page and add as sub-page to index
- [ ] Portfolio?
    - [ ] Computer Science
    - [ ] Engineering/Art stuff

## B64 Feedback: 

ayBu
- [ ] + Simple 
- [ ] - Too simple? 
- [ ] +/- I would have chosen a heavier font myself like standard Roberto. The font in the preview looks fine but the actual site is kind of eh

aCBu
- [ ] +/- Credit for background image could be smaller/nonexistent
- [ ] +/- and you could move the credit to the footer
- [ ] + If you can a little bit of scrollable stuff with a little personal blurb and photo would be good
    - [ ] + Maybe a small portfolio there too
    - [ ] + Also a menu maybe? CV/Projects/About me even if it's just links to subsections of the same page

I could do a mockup of the UX if you want
